> **Zero-downtime, AI-powered phased data migration platform for enterprise systems**

## 🚀 Overview

Enterprise Phased Migration Platform (EPMP) is a **production-grade data migration system** designed to migrate legacy databases to modern platforms **without downtime**.

It uses a **phased migration strategy**, strong **validation gates**, **parallel system operation via CDC**, **AI-based anomaly detection**, and **rollback safety** to ensure business continuity during critical migrations.

This project reflects **real enterprise architecture**, not a demo or toy project.
